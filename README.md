# 🤖 Human & Line Following Robot — My First Step into Robotics

This repository represents the **beginning of my robotics journey** — building a mobile robot capable of **following a human** and **tracking a line autonomously** using sensor feedback and differential drive control.

Even though this was my first project, it became the foundation that sparked my passion for **autonomous mobile robots and intelligent systems**.

## 🎯 Project Goals

| Mode | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| 🧍 Human Following | Robot maintains distance and keeps following a person |
| ➖ Line Following | Robot tracks and moves along a predefined line path |

The project taught me how **robots sense, think, and act using real-world feedback**.

## 🔧 How It Works

### 🔹 Sensors  
- Distance sensors measure how far the robot is from the human
- Infrared sensors detect the line on the floor

### 🔹 Processing  
Sensor values are converted into decisions like:

### 🔹 Actuation  
Based on the control logic, the microcontroller sends signals to the motors to perform the corresponding motion.

This was my **first exposure to control loops and autonomous behavior**.

## 🧠 What I Learned from This Project

| Robotics Domain | Learning |
|------------------|----------|
| Sensors | IR sensors, ultrasonic sensors, signal noise & placement |
| Control | Proportional corrections, threshold logic |
| Electronics | Motor drivers, wiring stability, power supply |
| Mechanics | Wheel alignment, friction & turning radius |
| Debugging | Trial-and-error, recalibration, real-world unpredictability |

This project showed me how **even the smallest change in alignment or code affects motion in the real world**.

## 🌟 Why This Project Is Special to Me

This wasn’t just a robot — it was the moment I realized that:

> Robots are not built in a single step.  
> They evolve — and so does the engineer building them.

Everything I have built since — AGVs, IK systems, UI-controlled arms, task-planning robots — grew from the curiosity I developed during this build.

## 🔮 Future Extensions (If I revisit the project)

- PID-based speed correction
- Mapping + localization
- Full human-tracking with deep learning
